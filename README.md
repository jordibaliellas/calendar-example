# Calendar

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Description

This project is a calender app with reminders and also and api integrated to get iformation about the selected day.

## Improvements

There are a lot of improvements that I would have done but I had no time:

-   More tests, I tested only one component to show that I can make some tests.
-   Better design, as you can see the design has been done really quickly
-   Better implementation of the external api, I used the url directly on the service
-   Better structure of scss, there are to many things in the styles.scss

Probably forgetting some other points

## Installation server

Use node 18 and run `npm install` to get all the dependecies that the project needs to run.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
